# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The goal of the project is to manipulate available datasets to create visualizations and aid in answering questions regarding the leading causes of death in the world.

## Process
1. Retrieval of Relevant Datasets: Causes of death & GDP per Capita.
2. EDA & Data Cleaning: Removal of empty rows and filling nulls using linear regression
3. Clean Data Manipulation: Uploading and merging of tables and creation of relevant fields
4. Visualizations: Creation of charts and maps to identify trends and patterns
5. Dashboard: Compilation of relevant visualizations to answer questions

## Results
Option 2, dataset 5: Causes of Death - Our World In Data was selected for this project, along with an additional dataset containing the GDP per Capita for each country.

The main questions to answer are:
#Which are the leading causes of death in the world?
#How do these causes of death vary over the last 30 years?
#How do causes differ between high-income and low-income countries?

The following visualizations were created to answer these questions:
#Packed bubbles chart showing the number of deaths due to different categories over the last 30 years.
#Line plot showing the World's Top 5 Causes of Death from 1990 to 2018, and forecast for the next five years.
#Stacked bars chart displaying the percentage of each death category for different levels of country income.
 
## Challenges 
Generating the required calculated fields using LOD expressions and producing the appropriate charts was challenging because of my lack of experience using Tableau and the little availability of easy-to-understand help resources online.

## Future Goals
Obtaining more datasets relevant to the project questions like deaths broken down by sex, age, individual income level, etc.
